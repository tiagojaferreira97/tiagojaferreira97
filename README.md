- 👋 Hi, I’m Tiago, Talent Acquisition at Blip.pt, Oporto.
- 🏤Blip is a top of the edge software engineering company with a difference. Founded in 2009, we already are 350+. And we’re always growing. We are part of Flutter Entertainment, a global sports betting, gaming and entertainment provider for over thirteen million customers worldwide.
Having merged with The Stars Group in 2020, Flutter Entertainment now has a host of brands that sit under it including Paddy Power and Betfair (PPB), Sky Betting and Gaming, PokerStars, Full Tilt Timeform, oddchecker, Sporting Life, SportsBet, Bet Easy in Australia, FOX Bet, TVG and FanDuel in the US.- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to talented developers with experience in Java, to collaborate in the development and maintenance of high scalability and low latency systems (you will be able to learn in depth about Kafka, Cassandra, etc...)
- 📫 You can reach me through tiago.ferreira@blip.pt / www.linkedin.com/in/tiagojaferreira/ or apply directly at www.blip.pt/jobs
- 🌱 I’m actually learning some code, so if you know some resorces for (100%) noobs, suggest it to me :)
